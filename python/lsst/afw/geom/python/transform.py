"""Python helpers for pybind11 wrapping of Transform classes and subclasses

Transform Classes and Subclasses
--------------------------------

Transforms are instances of
lsst::afw::geom::Transform<FromEndpoint, ToEndpoint>
and subclasses, such as lsst::afw::geom::SkyWcs.

In Python the templated Transform classes have names such as
`lsst.afw.geom.TransformSpherePointToPoint2` for
`lsst::afw::geom::Transform<SpherePointEndpoint, Point2Endpoint>`
