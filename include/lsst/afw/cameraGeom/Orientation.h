 * Describe a detector's orientation in the focal plane
 *
 * All rotations are about the reference point on the detector.
 * Rotations are intrinsic, meaning each rotation is applied in the coordinates system
 * produced by the previous rotation.
 * Rotations are applied in this order: yaw (Z), pitch (Y'), and roll (X'').
 *
 * @warning: default refPoint is -0.5, -0.5 (the lower left corner of a detector).
 * This means that the default-constructed Orientation is not a unity transform,
 * but instead includes a 1/2 pixel shift.
