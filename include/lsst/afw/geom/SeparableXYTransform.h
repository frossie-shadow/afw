 *
 * @deprecated Deprecated in 14.0. Will be removed in 15.0. It is partially
 *             replaced by ast::ParallelMap or ast::Mapping::under, but the
 *             replacement of Functors with Mappings must be done on a
 *             case-by-case basis.
 *
 *  The transformations in each direction are implemented as separate
 *  instances of concrete subclasses of the Functor base class.
