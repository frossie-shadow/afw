 * - It is well defined for any value of `nIn`, `nOut`.
 * - It stays small for small `x`, to avoid wraparound of angles for
 *      SpherePoint endpoints.

 * @param nIn,nOut The input and output dimensions of the desired PolyMap.
 * @returns a Mapping with a forward transform described by the equation above
